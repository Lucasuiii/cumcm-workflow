# Validation responsibility

## First review: full and context-separated

Build the current computation handoff, then run:

```bash
python3 "$S/build_independent_review_package.py" --project <project>
```

The package binds only canonical evidence for formal results: official inputs, problem/model contracts, `RESULTS_INDEX.json`, cited successful `official_run: true` manifests, matching source snapshots, formal inputs, claim-bearing outputs, and review instructions. It records `context_excluded` — the prior reasoning it physically left out — rather than asserting that the reviewer holds no conclusions. Failed/exploratory runs, stdout/stderr, full logs, and debug history are excluded; package/upstream freshness digests cover this same canonical set. Stop and route it to a separate task. The builder records the reviewer selection rather than asking the user to confirm it: separation now comes from the block cut itself, since the `computation-validation` handoff carries the task that produced it and `HANDOFF-E010` rejects a review whose `task_ref` matches. The result template ships with every remaining independence field `null`, so the reviewer has to assert them; a null fails `IREVIEW-E027`. Differing task references are a paste guard, not proof of independence. Same-model fresh-context review remains correlated. Task references improve context-separation evidence but cannot cryptographically prove reviewer independence.

## Findings and verdicts

Use the general review criteria in `assets/independent-review/REVIEW_REQUEST.md`: derive risks from the current problem, then check task coverage, model validity, implementation, discriminating evidence and claim scope. Classify by the consequence for the answer: P0 invalidates the answer or delivery; P1 is a material limitation within a supported, task-relevant answer; P2 is an optional improvement. Give concrete evidence for blockers, not a preference for a different model.

A valid proof can support a general claim; finite experiments support only their justified coverage. Scope reduction cannot erase an unanswered requirement. Review a repair's effect on other conclusions, not just the original failing case. Select a few high-value checks appropriate to the problem; no universal experiment checklist is required.

Verdicts are `accepted`, `accepted_with_concerns`, `revision_required`, and `inconclusive`. Only an open P0 permits `revision_required`. Open P1/P2 items remain visible as warnings or suggestions and do not block paper work.

After a full review returns open P0 findings, rerunning the package builder in auto mode defaults to a targeted re-review. It archives the prior review/package and targets every prior open P0. The new package embeds `TARGETED_FINDINGS.json` with only `finding_id`, `category`, `location`, `evidence`, and `recommendation`, so a fresh reviewer can work from the package alone without receiving the full old review. Do not turn unrelated newly noticed P1/P2 items into new blockers. A genuinely new P0 may still require revision.

## The one checkpoint in this block

Before building `validation-paper`, put the conclusions in front of the person and record the answer in `CLAIM_LEDGER.conclusion_check`. This is the cheap place to hear no: a rejection here costs a recomputation, the same rejection at delivery costs a rewritten paper.

Show the claim text, its `scope`, its evidence state, and every open P0/P1 from the review. Do not show run ids, hashes or evidence chains — nobody can audit those by eye, and putting them on the page only dilutes the few things a person can actually judge. `scope` is the one worth reading aloud: it is where a rule that only holds at the point it was derived from becomes visible.

`presented_claim_ids` records what was actually shown. `CLAIM-E023` rejects an acceptance that did not cover every declared claim, so the record cannot say a person approved a conclusion they never saw.

Create `CLAIM_LEDGER.json` from the reviewed evidence. Each paper-bearing claim records its exact text, scope, evidence IDs, evidence state, and limitations. Strong claims—global optimality, equivalence, causality, robustness, significance, or reproducibility—still need claim-specific support. `reproduced` requires an isolated rerun and comparison; an original successful run is only `supported_not_reproduced` unless stronger evidence exists.

Before paper writing, build `validation-paper`. For a targeted result, the builder follows only the structured `previous_review_path` lineage and applies the latest status per finding ID: open/accepted P1 concerns remain, while resolved findings drop out. Its limitations come from supported paper-eligible claim limitations, those current P1 concerns, and explicit model applicability, assumptions, and known limitations—not contradicted/unsupported claims or model `scope`. Its `representation_candidates` proactively identify trend, multi-group comparison, distribution, sensitivity, model-performance, and spatial/network/clustering evidence. A fresh paper task reads this compact handoff first, chooses prose/equation/table/figure, and does not scan full run/debug history.

After the explicit reply, use `record_decision.py --stage validation --decision accepted --confirm-human` with the reply reference and summary (see SKILL.md). It records the existing fields and advances state; paper handoff and initialization reject missing or stale human acceptance.
